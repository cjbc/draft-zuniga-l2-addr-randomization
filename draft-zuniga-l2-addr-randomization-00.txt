                     Layer-2 address randomization
                 draft-zuniga-l2-addr-randomization-00

Abstract

   Internet privacy is a serious concern nowadays.  Users' activity
   leaves a vast digital footprint, communications are not always
   properly secured and location can be easily tracked.  This document
   focuses on this last point, which is mainly caused by the use of IEEE
   Layer-2 immutable addresses, and the implications of that on upper
   layers, specially on IPv6 addresses.  Randomization of the addresses
   used at Layer-2 is a simple, but promising, solution to mitigate the
   location privacy issues.

   We report on existing support of address randomization by the
   different operating systems, and also on the conclusions obtained
   from conducting several trials during two IETF and one IEEE 802
   standards meetings.  Based on the obtained results we can conclude
   that address randomization is a feasible solution to the Layer-2
   privacy problem, but there needs to be other mechanisms used at
   higher layers to make the most benefit from it and minimize the
   service disruptions it may cause.

1.  Introduction

   Nowadays, Internet privacy is becoming a huge concern, as more and
   more devices are getting directly (e.g., via cellular or Wi-Fi) or
   indirectly (e.g., via a smartphone using Bluetooth) connected to the
   Internet.  This ubiquitous connectivity, together with not very
   secure protocol stacks and the lack of proper education about privacy
   make it very easy to track/monitor the location of users and/or
   eavesdrop their activity.  This is due to many factors, such as the
   vast digital footprint that users leave on the Internet (e.g.,
   sharing information on social networks, cookies used by browsers and
   servers to provide a better navigation experience, connectivity logs
   that allow tracking of a user's Layer-2 (L2) or Layer-3 (L3) address,
   web trackers, etc.) and/or the weak (or even null in some cases)
   authentication and encryption mechanisms used to secure
   communications.

   This privacy concern [wifi_internet_privacy] affects all layers of
   the protocol stack, from the lower ones involved in the actual access
   to the network (e.g., the Layer-2/Layer-3 addresses can be used to
   obtain the location of a user) to the applications, especially when
   browsing or using social networks (e.g., cookies can be used to find
   out the identity of a user accessing a particular site).

   This document focuses on the privacy threats at the network
   connectivity level, namely at the Layer-2 and Layer-3 of the protocol
   stack, but focusing especially on the issues related to the use of
   permanent Layer-2 addresses and the potential advatages gained from
   randomizing them.
