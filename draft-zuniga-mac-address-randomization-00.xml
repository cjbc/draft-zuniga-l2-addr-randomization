      <t>
Internet privacy has become a major concern over the past few years.  
Users are becoming more aware that their online activity  leaves a vast digital footprint, 
that communications are not always properly secured, and that their location and actions 
can be easily tracked. One of the main factors for the location tracking issue is the 
wide use of long-lasting identifiers, such as MAC addresses. 

      </t>

      <t>
There have been several initiatives at the IETF and the IEEE 802 standards committees to 
overcome some of these privacy issues. This document provides an overview of these activities, 
with the intention to inform the technical community about them, and help coordinate between 
present and futures standardization activities.

<!-- [2018-05-18] CJBC: some initial text slightly modified from our paper to
use as starting point. -->
      <t>
Internet privacy is becoming a huge concern, as more and more mobile devices
are getting directly (e.g., via cellular or Wi-Fi) or indirectly (e.g., via a
smartphone using Bluetooth) connected to the Internet. This ubiquitous
connectivity, together with not very secure protocol stacks and the lack of
proper education about privacy make it very easy to track/monitor the location
of users and/or eavesdrop their physical and online activities. This is due to many factors, such as
the vast digital footprint that users leave on the Internet, for instance sharing
information on social networks, cookies used by browsers and servers to provide
a better navigation experience, connectivity logs that allow tracking of a
user’s Layer-2 (L2/MAC) or Layer-3 (L3) address, web trackers, etc.; and/or the weak
(or even null in some cases) authentication and encryption mechanisms used to
secure communications.
      </t>

      <t>
This privacy concern affects all layers of the protocol stack, from the lower layers 
involved in the actual access to the network (e.g., the MAC/Layer-2 and Layer-3 addresses 
can be used to obtain the location of a user) to higher layer protocol identifiers and 
user applications <xref target="wifi_internet_privacy" />. In particular, IEEE 802 MAC 
addresses have historically been an easy target for tracking users [REF to some tracking cases].
      </t>

      <t>
There have been several initiatives at the IETF and the IEEE 802 standards committees 
to overcome some of these privacy issues. This document provides an overview of these 
activities, with the intention to inform the community and help coordinate between 
present and futures standardization activities.

<!-- BEGIN Problem statement -->
    <section anchor="sec:background" title="Background – MAC address usage">

        <t>
Most mobile devices used today are Wi-Fi enabled (i.e. they are equipped with an 
IEEE 802.11 wireless interface). Wi-Fi interfaces, as any other kind of IEEE 802-based 
network interface, like Ethernet (i.e. IEEE 802.3) have a Layer-2 address also referred 
to as MAC address, which can be seen by anybody who can receive the signal transmitted by 
the network interface. The format of these addresses is shown in Figure 1. 
        </t>

        <t>
		Figure 1: IEEE 802 MAC Address Format
        </t>		


        <t>
MAC addresses can either be universally administered or locally administered. Universally 
administered and locally administered addresses are distinguished by setting the 
second-least-significant bit of the most significant byte of the address (the U/L bit).
        </t>

        <t>
A universally administered address is uniquely assigned to a device by its manufacturer. 
Most physical devices are provided with a universally administered address, which is composed 
of two parts: (i) the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI), which are the first 
three octets in transmission order and identify the organization that issued the identifier, 
and (ii) Network Interface Controller (NIC) Specific, which are the following three octets, 
assigned by the organization that manufactured the NIC, in such a way that the resulting 
MAC address is globally unique. 
        </t>
		
		<t>
Locally administered addresses override the burned-in address, and they are usually set-up 
by the network administrator. However, as explained in further sections of this document, 
there are new initiatives at the IEEE 802 to specify ways in which these locally administered 
addresses should be assigned, depending on the use case.		
        </t>

    </section>
<!-- END Problem statement -->

<!-- BEGIN MAC address randomization -->
    <section anchor="sec:mac_addr_random" title="MAC address randomization">

      <t>
Since universally administered MAC addresses are by definition globally-unique, when a device 
uses this MAC address to transmit data -especially over the air- it is relatively easy to track 
this device by simple medium observation. Since a device is usually directly associated to an 
individual, this poses a privacy concern <xref target="link_layer_privacy" />.
      </t>

      <t>
MAC addresses can be easily observed by a third party, such as a passive device listening to 
communications in the same network. In an 802.11 network, a station exposes its MAC address in 
two different situations:	  
      </t>

<t><list style="symbols">
	  <t>
While actively scanning for available networks, the MAC address is used in the Probe Request 
frames sent by the device (aka IEEE 802.11 STA).
      </t>
	  
	  <t>
Once associated to a given Access Point (AP), the MAC address is used in frame transmission and 
reception, as one of the addresses used in the address fields of an IEEE 802.11 frame.
      </t>
</list></t>
	  
	  <t>
One way to overcome this privacy concern is by using randomly generated MAC addresses. 
As described in the previous section, the IEEE 802 addressing includes one bit to specify if the 
hardware address is locally or globally administered. This allows generating local addresses 
without the need of any global coordination mechanism to ensure that the generated address is unique.
This feature can be used to generate random addresses <xref target="enhancing_location_privacy" />, and therefore makes it more difficult 
to track a user device from its MAC/L2 address. 
      </t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="sec:mac_addr_experiments" title="Experiments at IETF and IEEE 802 meetings">	  
	  <t>
In order to test the effects of MAC address randomization, major trials were conducted at the 
IETF and IEEE 802 meetings between November 2014 and March 2015 - IETF91, IETF92 and IEEE 802 Plenary in Berlin. 
The purpose of the experiments was to evaluate the use of MAC address randomization from two 
different perspectives: (i) the effect on the connectivity experience of the end-user, also checking 
if applications and operating systems (OSs) were affected; and (ii) the potential impact on the 
network infrastructure itself. Some of the findings were published in <xref target="wifi_internet_privacy" />. 
      </t>

      <t>
During the experiments it was observed that the probability of address duplication in a network with this characteristics is negligible. 
The experiments also showed that other protocol identifiers can be correlated and therefore be used to still track an individual. Hence, 
effective privacy tools should not work in isolation at a single layer, but they should be coordinated with other privacy features at higher layers. 
Since then, the MAC address randomization feature has been used every time by more devices and operating systems [REF??].
