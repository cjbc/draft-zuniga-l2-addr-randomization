      <t>
Internet privacy is a serious concern nowadays. Users’ activity leaves a vast
digital footprint, communications are not always properly secured and location
can be easily tracked. This document focuses on this last point, which is mainly
caused by the use of IEEE Layer-2 immutable addresses, and the implications of
that on upper layers, specially on IPv6 addresses. Randomization of the
addresses used at Layer-2 is a simple, but promising, solution to mitigate the
location privacy issues.
      </t>

      <t>
We report on existing support of address randomization by the different
operating systems, and also on the conclusions obtained from conducting several
trials during two IETF and one IEEE 802 standards meetings. Based on the
obtained results we can conclude that address randomization is a feasible
solution to the Layer-2 privacy problem, but there needs to be other mechanisms
used at higher layers to make the most benefit from it and minimize the service
disruptions it may cause.

    <section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">

<!-- [2018-05-18] CJBC: some initial text slightly modified from our paper to
use as starting point. -->
      <t>
Nowadays, Internet privacy is becoming a huge concern, as more and more devices
are getting directly (e.g., via cellular or Wi-Fi) or indirectly (e.g., via a
smartphone using Bluetooth) connected to the Internet. This ubiquitous
connectivity, together with not very secure protocol stacks and the lack of
proper education about privacy make it very easy to track/monitor the location
of users and/or eavesdrop their activity. This is due to many factors, such as
the vast digital footprint that users leave on the Internet (e.g., sharing
information on social networks, cookies used by browsers and servers to provide
a better navigation experience, connectivity logs that allow tracking of a
user’s Layer-2 (L2) or Layer-3 (L3) address, web trackers, etc.) and/or the weak
(or even null in some cases) authentication and encryption mechanisms used to
secure communications.
      </t>

      <t>
This privacy concern <xref target="wifi_internet_privacy" /> affects all layers
of the protocol stack, from the lower ones involved in the actual access to the
network (e.g., the Layer-2/Layer-3 addresses can be used to obtain the location
of a user) to the applications, especially when browsing or using social
networks (e.g., cookies can be used to find out the identity of a user accessing
a particular site).
      </t>

      <t>
This document focuses on the privacy threats at the network connectivity level,
namely at the Layer-2 and Layer-3 of the protocol stack, but focusing especially
on the issues related to the use of permanent Layer-2 addresses and the
potential advatages gained from randomizing them.
